# Crime Incidents & Venues Data Analysis in Boston, Massachusetts

(Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods)

## Introduction/Business Problem
The goal of this capstone project is to explore and extrapolate exisiting data to solve real life problems. Hence, for this project, we will look at which location in Boston is most promising for opening a new restaurant. Specifically, we will explore the crime rates in the 12 districts of Boston, different types of venues in each location, and output the safest and most profitable location to open a restaurant venue. 

## Data
1. Crime incident reports will be downloaded from the website Analyze Boston, which contains numerous open source data sets of Boston. The data set crime incident reports from August 2015 to current date will be used for analysis because of its most up-to-date information. 

2. Due to a lack of district name in the crime incident reports data set, another table which has the district name and the district number will be used for more efficient analysis. 

3. In order to obtain venue information around the districts in Boston, the Forsquare API will be used to get the most common venues in each district. This will gives us an understanding of the types and number of venues that are located in Boston.
